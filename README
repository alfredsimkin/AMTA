The original input files are:
1. A list of all Refseq gene annotations from UCSC in BED format
2. A large sequence alignment file aligning every part of the gorilla genome 
to 10 other primates, downloaded from UCSC in MAF format
3. individual primate genomes for five species

The core of my analysis is done using two publicly available programs, 
called lastz (used to compare genomes against each other) and dnaml (used to 
reconstruct hypothetical ancestral DNA sequences from living primate 
descendants)

There are 3 main scripts needed to get my main results, each of which is a 
collection of smaller scripts. They're named:

main_script.py
main_script2.py
main_script3.py

Each of these scripts has a short description of each of the smaller scripts
called in comment lines.
