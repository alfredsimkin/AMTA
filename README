The original input files are:
1. A list of all Refseq gene annotations from UCSC in BED format
2. A large sequence alignment file aligning every part of the gorilla genome 
to 10 other primates, downloaded from UCSC in MAF format
3. individual primate genomes for five species

The core of my analysis is done using two publicly available programs, 
called lastz (used to compare genomes against each other) and dnaml (used to 
reconstruct hypothetical ancestral DNA sequences from living primate 
descendants, available from Joe Felsenstein's phylip package). You will need
to have these programs installed.

There are 3 main scripts needed to get my main results, each of which is a 
collection of smaller scripts. They're named:

prepare_lastz.py
orthologs_alignments_ancestors.py
calculate_turnover_rates.py

Each of these scripts is a driver for several smaller scripts, described in
the comments.

Briefly, prepare_lastz.py tidies up a BED file of transcripts in one genome and
prepares to search other genomes for these transcripts. The program also tidies up
a MAF file for use later on.

After running lastz on the results of prepare_lastz.py,
orthologs_alignments_ancestors.py uses stringent filters to remove non 1 to 1 orthologs
from the dataset, creates alignments of these 1 to 1 orthologs using the MAF file, and
uses DNAML to reconstruct ancestral transcript states.

calculate_turnover_rates.py operates on the output of orthologs_alignments_ancestors.py
and calculates how fast every 8mer turns over relative to other highly similar 8mers.
