To make a maximum likelihood reconstruction of ancestral states using simulated
data:

create a newick file for dnaml to build a phylogeny, saved as 'intree'
convert the sfs simulated data to fasta format (sfs_to_fasta.py)
open the fasta file and change any species names to match the newick file
convert the fasta file to a dictionary (fasta_to_dict.py)
convert the dictionary to a phylip file, saved as 'infile' (make_vert_phylip.py)
run dnaml on the phylip file, with the command dnaml <dnaml_input (only works if
outfile and outtree already exist, modify <dnaml_input as needed)
run collect_ancestors.py to get reconstructed ancestors stored as a dictionary (may
need some adjustment if using a different phylogeny)

run normal scripts on output dictionary:

count_gains_losses.py
distributions_by_eightmer.py
distribution_sums.py
nearest_neighbor_values.py
counts_by_branch.py
